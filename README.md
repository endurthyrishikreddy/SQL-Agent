## üöÄ Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- Google Gemini API key

### Installation

1. **Clone or download this repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd sql_agent_llm
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Set up your API key (Choose one method)**

   **Method 1: Automated Setup (Recommended)**
   ```bash
   python setup_env.py
   ```
   This will securely prompt you for your API key and create the `.env` file.

   **Method 2: Manual Environment Variable**
   ```bash
   # Copy the example file
   cp env_example.txt .env
   
   # Edit .env file and add your API key
   # GEMINI_API_KEY=your_actual_api_key_here
   ```

   **Method 3: Direct Input**
   - Run the app and enter your API key in the sidebar
   - Note: This is less secure and requires re-entry on each session

4. **Generate sample data (optional)**
   ```bash
   # For single table data
   python create_sample_data.py
   
   # For correlated multi-table data
   python create_correlated_data.py
   ```

5. **Run the application**
   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

6. **Open your browser**
   Navigate to `http://localhost:8501`

## üìñ How to Use

### Step 1: Configure API Key
- Enter your Google Gemini API key in the sidebar
- The application uses Gemini 2.0 Flash for SQL generation

### Step 2: Upload Excel Files
- Drag and drop one or more Excel/CSV files or click to browse
- Supported formats: `.xlsx`, `.xls`, `.csv`
- All files will be automatically converted to tables in a SQLite database
- You can upload related files (e.g., customers, orders, sales) for correlated queries

### Step 3: Ask Questions
- Use natural language to ask questions about your data
- For single files:
  - "Show me the top 10 sales by region"
  - "What is the average salary by department?"
  - "Find all employees hired in 2023"
- For multiple files (correlated queries):
  - "Show me sales with customer and employee names"
  - "Find customers who have both sales and orders"
  - "Compare sales performance by employee department"
  - "Show me total revenue by customer city"

### Step 4: View Results
- Generated SQL query is displayed with syntax highlighting
- Query results are shown in a data table
- Automatic visualizations are created for numeric data
- Download results as CSV if needed

## üéØ Example Questions

### Single Table Queries
**Sales Data:**
- "Show me the top 5 products by total sales"
- "What is the average order value by region?"
- "Find all orders above $1000"
- "Calculate monthly sales trends"

**Employee Data:**
- "Show me employees with salary above $80,000"
- "What is the average age by department?"
- "Find the highest paid employee in each department"
- "Show me employees hired in the last year"

**Customer Data:**
- "Which cities have the most customers?"
- "Show me customers who spent more than $5000"
- "What is the average order count per customer type?"
- "Find customers registered in 2023"

### Multi-Table Correlated Queries
**Customer-Sales Analysis:**
- "Show me sales with customer and employee names"
- "Find customers who have both sales and orders"
- "Show me total revenue by customer city"
- "Compare sales performance by customer type"

**Employee-Sales Analysis:**
- "Compare sales performance by employee department"
- "Find employees who made sales to enterprise customers"
- "Show me employee sales ranking by total amount"
- "Calculate average sale amount by employee"

**Cross-Table Analysis:**
- "Find customers who have orders but no sales"
- "Show me sales and orders for the same customer"
- "Compare order status distribution by customer type"
- "Find the most active customers across all tables"

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

### Core Components

1. **Streamlit Web Interface** (`app.py`)
   - File upload handling
   - User interface and interactions
   - Data visualization
   - Results display

2. **SQL Agent** (`sql_agent.py`)
   - OpenAI integration for SQL generation
   - Database schema analysis
   - Query execution and validation
   - Natural language processing

3. **Data Processing**
   - Excel to SQLite conversion

### Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: Streamlit
- **Backend**: Python
- **Database**: SQLite
- **AI**: Google Gemini 2.0 Flash
- **Data Processing**: Pandas, SQLAlchemy
- **Visualization**: Plotly
- **Excel Handling**: OpenPyXL

## üîß Configuration

### Environment Variables
Create a `.env` file in the project root:
```env
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_google_gemini_api_key_here
```

**Security Best Practices:**
- Never commit your `.env` file to version control
- The `.env` file is already included in `.gitignore`
- Use environment variables for production deployments
- Consider using a secrets management service for production

### Customization Options

1. **Model Configuration**: Modify the model in `sql_agent.py`
   ```python
   self.llm = ChatGoogleGenerativeAI(
       model="gemini-2.0-flash",  # Change to gemini-2.0-exp for better results
       temperature=0,
       google_api_key=api_key
   )
   ```

2. **Database Settings**: Adjust database creation in `app.py`
   ```python
   engine = create_engine(f'sqlite:///{db_path}', echo=True)
   ```

3. **UI Customization**: Modify CSS styles in `app.py`

## üìä Sample Data

The application includes sample data generation for testing:

- **Sales Data**: 1000 records with order details, regions, products
- **Employee Data**: 500 records with employee information, departments, salaries
- **Customer Data**: 300 records with customer profiles and order history

Run `python sample_data.py` to generate these files.

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Google Gemini API Key Error**
   - Ensure your API key is valid and has sufficient credits
   - Check if the key is entered correctly in the sidebar or environment variable
   - Verify the `.env` file is in the project root directory
   - Make sure the environment variable name is `GEMINI_API_KEY` or `GOOGLE_API_KEY`

2. **File Upload Issues**
   - Verify the Excel file is not corrupted
   - Check file format (.xlsx or .xls)
   - Ensure file size is reasonable (< 100MB)

3. **SQL Generation Errors**
   - Try rephrasing your question
   - Check if column names in your data match your question
   - Use the sample questions as reference
   - **Fixed**: SQL syntax errors with extra prefixes (like "ite") are now automatically cleaned

4. **Performance Issues**
   - Large files may take longer to process
   - Consider splitting large datasets
   - Use LIMIT in your questions for large result sets

### Error Messages

- **"Error reading file"**: Check file format and corruption
- **"Error executing SQL query"**: Review generated SQL syntax
- **"API Key not configured"**: Enter valid Google Gemini API key

### Recent Fixes

- **SQL Query Cleaning**: Enhanced the SQL cleaning function to automatically remove extra text prefixes that sometimes appear in LLM responses
- **Better Error Handling**: Improved validation to catch malformed SQL queries before execution
- **Enhanced Prompts**: Updated system prompts to generate cleaner SQL queries

## üîí Security Considerations

- API keys are stored in session state only
- Temporary database files are created for each session
- No data is permanently stored on the server
- Consider using environment variables for production
